# Video Placeholder Note

The home.html page references `assets/dental-video.mp4` which doesn't exist yet.

## To add your video:
1. Place your dental procedure/clinic video in the `assets` folder
2. Name it `dental-video.mp4`
3. The video will autoplay, loop, and be muted by default

## Temporary Solution:
For now, the video element will show a fallback message. You can:
- Add any MP4 video to test
- Or remove the video card temporarily

The page will work fine without the video - it just won't display that card's content.
